  <p>The COVID-19 lockdown produced behavioral, psychosocial and environmental
    changes which has led to widespread rapid weight gain amongst people due to
    an increase in food shopping, consumption and sedentary lifestyle. <br>
This was a classroom assignment which I reiterated into a side project.
I conducted quantitative surveys, interviewed people (age group:19-23 ) to learn
about change in their behavior, consumption and lifestyle due to the lockdown and
 designed KnowMart; a product with online grocery shopping services with integrated
 meal planning which helps people become more aware of what they are buying and eating.</p>

  <p>
    The challenge was to identify a problem in the area of “Education and Learning”
    caused by the COVID - 19 pandemic and design an impactful, innovative and feasible
    solution that uses digital technology to solve the identified problem.

    I chose to understand and empathise with students pursuing higher education
    in India and uncover the problems faced by them.
  According to UNESCO, about 32 crore learners were affected in India.
  Out of which about 3.4 crore learners were pursuing higher education.  </p>

    <p>
      The double diamond framework acted as a roadmap to design for this problem.
      It helped me to first diverge and dig deep into the problem area by conducting 
      both primary and secondary research then to converge from observations to
      insights to a HMW statement. Further diverging and brainstorming ideas and
      finally converging to a solution.

    <p>
      COVID - 19 Pandemic took an unprecedented test on education. It was tough

      This product is valid and needed irrespective of a pandemic or not, it will
      make students’ lives easier, college is hard enough already.  </p>

Tested with 8 people out of which 75% (6 people) were satisfied. <br>
Suggestions from users: <br>
▶ If the user is adding a product in the cart, it should show whether it is in the kitchen or not/ last added. <br>
▶ If the product user is adding in the cart is unhealthy, give warning. <br>
▶ Features like food journal with personal comments, community of people pursuing healthy lifestyle could be added. <br>
▶ Micro-animation and illustration could be added. <br>
There is a lot of scope for reiteration. </p>
