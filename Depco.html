  <p>Depco is a developer productivity and collaboration platform which is used
    in the software development life cycle by developers, architects and project managers.
Designit is working with Wipro to reimagine Depco.
<br> <br>
For my graduation project, the brief was to reimagine the task management
and knowledge base experience for Depco,
to improve developer productivity and enable collaboration across teams. <br>
I collaborated with the research team to understand the domain, the problem faced
by the users, and the reasoning behind their recommendations. Thereafter, I designed
the knowledge base and task management experience for Depco which helps developers,
 architects, and PMs find the relevant resources from documents to experts. It also
 enabled them to plan and track their projects and tasks efficiently.

  <p>
    To reimagine the task management and knowledge base experience for Depco, in
    order to improve developer productivity and enable collaboration across teams. 
<br> <br>
    <b> A knowledge base</b> is an online library of information about a product or
    topic. It can be used to form toolkits and find experts. <br>
    <i>(A toolkit is a collection of documents that a project manager uses to introduce and
    inform developers about a project. It may include FAQs, guidebooks, blogs, articles,
     video demonstrations, glossaries, courses etc.)</i> <br> <br>


<b>Task management</b> is the process of managing a task through its life cycle.
It involves planning, testing, tracking, and reporting.

<br> <br>
<div class="row">
<div class="column">
  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="column-8">
  <p>
   I designed a knowledge base that not only enables users to find documents and other forms
    of knowledge resources but also helps them connect with experts in the field within
    the organization. A simple task management experience was designed to help them plan
    and track their projects and tasks. <br> <br>
    The knowledge base and task management experience of Depco were designed from
    scratch based on the challenges identified during the research phase as a part of my project brief.  </p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column-8">
    <p>
      The design process was divided into two phases- <br>
<b>Phase 1: Discover</b><br>
The discovery phase was a team effort that included 2 researchers, the project manager
and me, UX/UI design intern. It started from stakeholder alignment, followed by
contextual study, primary research, and then synthesis and analysis of the research.
<br> <br>
<b>Phase 2: Design</b> <br>
The design phase was an individual effort. Keeping the design guiding principles
in mind from the research outcomes, I divided the design realisation activities
into four parts - starting from research, followed by wireframing, visualizing,
and finally prototyping my designs.

    <p>
      <b>Embracing Ambiguity</b><br>
  I had no idea about this domain when I started but with each day and
  interview I got better.<br><br>
  <b>Team Work</b><br>
  I understood the significance of team work and stepping up for your
  team whenever needed.<br><br>
  <b>Project Packaging</b><br>
  It is important to package your presentation according to the audience
  and in a consumable fashion.<br><br>
  <b>Feedbacks are Opportunities</b><br>
  Feedbacks are not personal failures but an opportunity to get new
  perspective, discuss your work, learn and grow.<br><br>
  <b>Remote Research and Collaboration</b><br>
  It was my first time doing an extensive research remotely with a team.
  Softwares became my best friends and every word from the research was
  important.<br><br>
  <b>Intricacies of UI Design</b> <br>
  I have learnt to iterate, reiterate till I succeed.</p>
