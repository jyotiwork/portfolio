  <p>Depco is a developer productivity and collaboration platform which is used
    in the software development life cycle by developers, architects and project managers.
Designit is working with Wipro to reimagine Depco.
<br> <br>
For my graduation project, the brief was to reimagine the task management
and knowledge base experience for Depco,
to improve developer productivity and enable collaboration across teams. <br>
I collaborated with the research team to understand the domain, the problem faced
by the users, and the reasoning behind their recommendations. Thereafter, I designed
the knowledge base and task management experience for Depco which helps developers,
 architects, and PMs find the relevant resources from documents to experts. It also
 enabled them to plan and track their projects and tasks efficiently.

  <p>
    To reimagine the task management and knowledge base experience for Depco, in
    order to improve developer productivity and enable collaboration across teams. 
<br> <br>
    <b> A knowledge base</b> is an online library of information about a product or
    topic. It can be used to form toolkits and find experts. <br> <br>


<b>Task management</b> is the process of managing a task through its life cycle.
It involves planning, testing, tracking, and reporting.

  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="column-8">
  <p>
   I designed a knowledge base that not only enables users to find documents and other forms
    of knowledge resources but also helps them connect with experts in the field within
    the organization. A simple task management experience was designed to help them plan
    and track their projects and tasks. <br> <br>
    The knowledge base and task management experience of Depco were designed from
    scratch based on the challenges identified during the research phase as a part of my project brief.  </p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column-8">
    <p>
      The design process was divided into two phases- <br>
<b>Phase 1: Discover</b><br>
The discovery phase was a team effort that included 2 researchers, the project manager
and me, UX/UI design intern. It started from stakeholder alignment, followed by
contextual study, primary research, and then synthesis and analysis of the research.
<br> <br>
<b>Phase 2: Design</b> <br>
The design phase was an individual effort. Keeping the design guiding principles
in mind from the research outcomes, I divided the design realisation activities
into four parts - starting from research, followed by wireframing, visualizing,
and finally prototyping my designs.

▶ If the product user is adding in the cart is unhealthy, give warning. <br>
▶ Features like food journal with personal comments, community of people pursuing healthy lifestyle could be added. <br>
▶ Micro-animation and illustration could be added. <br>
