  <p>The COVID-19 lockdown produced behavioral, psychosocial and environmental
    changes which has led to widespread rapid weight gain amongst people due to
    an increase in food shopping, consumption and sedentary lifestyle. <br>
This was a classroom assignment which I reiterated into a side project.
I conducted quantitative surveys, interviewed people (age group:19-23 ) to learn
about change in their behavior, consumption and lifestyle due to the lockdown and
 designed KnowMart; a product with online grocery shopping services with integrated
 meal planning which helps people become more aware of what they are buying and eating.</p>

  <p>
  KnowMart is an app which provides online grocery shopping services with integrated
  meal planning to help people become mindful of what they are buying and eating.
  It also helps people have better dietary quality, cook diversified meals, save
  money and also addresses the issue of not knowing what to prepare for meals. ​​​​​​​ </p>

    <div class="column-8">
    <p>
    The double diamond framework acted as a roadmap to design for this problem.
    It helped me to first diverge and dig deep into the problem area by conducting
     both primary and secondary research then to converge from observations to
     insights to a HMW statement. Further diverging and brainstorming ideas and
     finally converging to a solution.  </p>

    <div class="column-8">
<p>
I read journals, articles and papers about the changes in human behavior, lifestyle,
consumer trends during the lockdown which further led me to reading about weight
gain/loss, nutrition and mindful eating. Some of the key findings for the project: <br> <br>
▶ People have gained weight due to an increase in food shopping, consumption and
sedentary lifestyle in the lockdown.<br>
▶ While people are trying to eat healthy to strengthen their immune system against
the virus, due to stress and anxiety, they are binge eating as well. <br>
▶ Healthy, balanced and mindful eating should not be a fad diet but inculcated
as a part of people's lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="column-8">
<p> ▶ 44% people shop for groceries online only. <br>
▶ 37% people gained weight during the lockdown. <br>
▶ 50% people used to exercise at the beginning of the lockdown but have stopped now. <br>
▶ 37% people binge more now whereas 42% people have started eating more mindfully now. <br>
▶ 50% of the people have tried meal planning. <br>
▶ People are more likely to check for ingredients/nutrients in the product than calories. </p>

▶ If the product user is adding in the cart is unhealthy, give warning. <br>
▶ Features like food journal with personal comments, community of people pursuing healthy lifestyle could be added. <br>
